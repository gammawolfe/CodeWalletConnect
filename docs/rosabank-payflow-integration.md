# RoSaBank-PayFlow Integration: User Journey & Payment Processing

## Overview

This document explains how RoSaBank users interact with their wallets through PayFlow's B2B infrastructure, and how transactions flow from user actions to payment gateways like Stripe. PayFlow serves as the invisible financial backbone that powers RoSaBank's ROSCA platform.

## Architecture Summary

```
RoSaBank Users → RoSaBank App → PayFlow API → Payment Gateway (Stripe) → Bank/Card Network

     └── Real-time Updates ←── Webhooks ←── Transaction Confirmation
```

## Detailed User Journey

### 1. User Interacts with RoSaBank App

**User Experience:**
- Users open the RoSaBank mobile/web application (consumer-facing)
- They see their ROSCA groups, savings goals, and contribution schedules
- Users initiate financial actions like:
  - "Add money to group wallet"
  - "Join new ROSCA group"
  - "Make monthly contribution"
  - "Request payout from completed ROSCA"

**User Interface:**
- Clean, simple interface focused on ROSCA functionality
- No mention of PayFlow or technical payment details
- Real-time balance updates and transaction status

### 2. RoSaBank Backend → PayFlow API Integration

When a user takes action, RoSaBank's backend communicates with PayFlow:

```javascript
// RoSaBank backend integration
const payflowClient = new PayFlowClient({
  apiKey: 'pk_live_rosabank_abc789',
  baseURL: 'https://api.payflow.com',
  environment: 'production'
});

// Example: User adds $50 to their ROSCA group
const transaction = await payflowClient.wallets.addFunds({
  walletId: 'wallet_rosca_group_123',
  amount: 5000, // $50.00 in cents
  currency: 'USD',
  source: 'user_payment_method',
  metadata: {
    user_id: 'rosabank_user_456',
    rosca_group: 'weekly_savings_circle_7',
    contribution_week: 12
  }
});
```

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `POST /api/v1/wallets/{id}/add-funds` - Add money to wallet
- `POST /api/v1/wallets/{id}/transfer` - Transfer between wallets
- `GET /api/v1/wallets/{id}/balance` - Check current balance
- `POST /api/v1/payouts` - Request payout to bank account

### 3. PayFlow Processes the Request

PayFlow receives the API call and orchestrates the transaction:

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Validates RoSaBank's API key and permissions
- Confirms wallet access and transaction limits
- Applies business rules and compliance checks

**Transaction Processing:**
- Creates a payment intent for the transaction
- Routes to the appropriate payment gateway adapter
- Initiates double-entry ledger recording
- Generates unique transaction ID for tracking

**Gateway Selection:**
- Chooses optimal payment gateway based on:
  - Transaction amount and type
  - User location and preferences
  - Gateway availability and rates
  - Compliance requirements

### 4. Payment Gateway Processing

PayFlow communicates with Stripe (or other configured gateways):

```javascript
// PayFlow internal gateway adapter
const stripeAdapter = new StripeAdapter({
  secretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
});

// Create payment intent
const paymentIntent = await stripeAdapter.createPaymentIntent({
  amount: 5000,
  currency: 'usd',
  customer: rosabank_customer_stripe_id,
  payment_method: user_payment_method_id,
  metadata: {
    wallet_id: 'wallet_rosca_group_123',
    partner_app: 'rosabank',
    transaction_type: 'rosca_contribution'
  }
});

// Confirm payment
const result = await stripeAdapter.confirmPayment(paymentIntent.id);
```

**Gateway Responsibilities:**
- Process credit card or bank account charge
- Handle 3D Secure authentication if required
- Manage fraud detection and risk assessment
- Return transaction status and confirmation

### 5. Real-time Updates via Webhooks

**Stripe → PayFlow Webhook:**
```json
{
  "type": "payment_intent.succeeded",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "pi_stripe_payment_123",
      "amount": 5000,
      "status": "succeeded",
      "metadata": {
        "wallet_id": "wallet_rosca_group_123",
        "partner_app": "rosabank"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**PayFlow Processing:**
- Verifies webhook signature for security
- Updates double-entry ledger system
- Calculates new wallet balances
- Records transaction in audit trail

**PayFlow → RoSaBank Webhook:**
```json
{
  "event": "wallet.funds_added",
  "wallet_id": "wallet_rosca_group_123",
  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "transaction_id": "txn_payflow_789",
  "status": "completed",
  "timestamp": "2024-08-11T22:45:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "user_id": "rosabank_user_456",
    "rosca_group": "weekly_savings_circle_7"
  }
}
```

### 6. User Sees Final Results
