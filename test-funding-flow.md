# Wallet Funding Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented the missing wallet funding endpoints for PayFlow as requested. Here's what was built:

### 1. Database Schema ✅
- Added `funding_sessions` table with proper foreign keys and relations
- Added `funding_session_status` enum with states: created, active, completed, failed, expired
- Integrated with existing wallet and transaction systems

### 2. Backend API Endpoints ✅

**POST /api/v1/wallets/{walletId}/fund**
- Creates Stripe Payment Intent and funding session
- Requires API key authentication and wallet ownership validation
- Returns session details with payment URL
- Follows existing authentication and validation patterns

**GET /api/v1/funding/sessions/{sessionId}**
- Retrieves funding session status
- Partner-scoped access (only wallet owner can access)
- Returns session details and payment status

**GET /api/public/funding/sessions/{sessionId}** (Public endpoint)
- Public endpoint for payment page access
- Returns session data with Stripe client secret
- Handles session expiration checks

### 3. Payment Processing ✅

**Enhanced Webhook Handler**
- Processes `payment_intent.succeeded` events for funding sessions
- Automatically credits wallet when payment completes
- Uses idempotency key (payment intent ID) to prevent duplicates
- Handles payment failures by marking sessions as failed
- Distinguishes between funding sessions and regular transactions via metadata

**Funding Service**
- Manages session lifecycle (creation, status updates, completion)
- Integrates with existing wallet credit functionality
- Generates secure session IDs
- Handles payment URL generation

### 4. Frontend Payment Page ✅
- React component at `/pay/{sessionId}`
- Full Stripe Elements integration for secure payment processing
- Responsive design with loading states and error handling
- Session expiration handling
- Redirect support for success/cancel URLs
- No authentication required (public access)

### 5. Repository Layer ✅
- `FundingSessionsRepository` with full CRUD operations
- Methods for finding sessions by payment intent ID
- Batch operations for marking expired sessions
- Follows existing repository patterns

## Integration Points

### Stripe Integration
- Uses existing Stripe adapter patterns
- Metadata includes wallet_id, partner_id, and session_type='funding'
- Webhook signature verification via existing infrastructure
- Payment Intent creation with proper amount conversion

### Wallet System Integration
- Reuses existing `walletService.creditWallet()` method
- Maintains double-entry ledger integrity
- Respects partner data scoping
- Uses existing transaction idempotency patterns

### Database Integration
- Follows existing Drizzle ORM patterns
- Proper foreign key relationships to wallets table
- Consistent naming conventions and field types
- Supports existing audit trail requirements

## Cooper Client Flow Support

The implementation exactly matches Cooper client requirements:

1. **Cooper** calls `POST /api/v1/wallets/{walletId}/fund` with amount and metadata
2. **PayFlow** creates Stripe Payment Intent and returns session with payment URL
3. **User** visits payment URL (`/pay/{sessionId}`) and completes payment on PayFlow domain  
4. **Stripe** webhook notifies PayFlow of successful payment
5. **PayFlow** credits wallet and marks session as completed
6. **User** redirected back to Cooper via successUrl

## Security Features

- API key authentication for partner endpoints
- Partner data scoping (wallets belong to partners)
- Session expiration (30 minutes)
- Stripe webhook signature verification
- HTTPS-only payment pages
- No sensitive data exposed in public endpoints

## What's Ready for Testing

1. **Database schema** - Ready to be pushed via `npm run db:push`
2. **API endpoints** - All endpoints implemented and tested for TypeScript compilation
3. **Payment page** - React component ready with Stripe integration
4. **Webhook processing** - Enhanced to handle funding session completion

## Environment Variables Needed

For full functionality, these environment variables should be set:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - For payment processing
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (frontend) - For Stripe Elements
- `PAYFLOW_FRONTEND_URL` - Base URL for payment page links

## Next Steps

1. **Push database schema** - Run `npm run db:push` to create the funding_sessions table
2. **Set environment variables** - Configure Stripe keys for testing
3. **Test with Cooper client** - The endpoints now exist and should work with Cooper's integration
4. **Monitor webhooks** - Verify Stripe webhooks are properly configured

The implementation follows all existing patterns in the PayFlow codebase and maintains the security and data integrity requirements of a financial system.
